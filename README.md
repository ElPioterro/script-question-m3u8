# script-question-m3u8

I'm trying to create a script in Tampermonkey that downloads m3u8 file from an website. 
Name of the file needs to be pulled from a div with class = ``` "course-player__content-header__title" ```
It downloads only when div with class = "download-btn" is clicked.
Div with class download-btn needs to be appended to div with id = "course-player-footer"

I'm dealing with a webiste that has loading screen after it loaded. 
After few seconds all divs and layout shows up - thats why i use runWhenReady function
